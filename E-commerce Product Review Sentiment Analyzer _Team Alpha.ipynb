    "### Introduction\n",
    "The project aims to develop a sentiment analyzer for e-commerce product reviews sourced from Aliexpress, focusing on the Electronics category. The Project involves various aspects of data science, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, deployment, and pipeline implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Company\n",
    "AliExpress is a globally renowned e-commerce platform that connects consumers with millions of products at competitive prices. AliExpress provides a seamless shopping experience, empowering individuals and businesses to discover, purchase, and sell quality products from trusted sellers across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "E-commerce platforms grapple with the challenge of analyzing vast amounts of customer feedback to accurately understand product sentiment. Understanding this sentiment is critical for businesses to make informed decisions regarding product improvements, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction. However, manually analyzing thousands of product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient. Consequently, an automated sentiment analysis solution is required to effectively process and interpret these reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Objectives\n",
    "- Develop an accurate and efficient sentiment analysis model for e-commerce product reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract valuable insights from customer reviews to inform product improvement and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhance customer satisfaction by providing businesses with a deeper understanding of customer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This project aimed to develop a sentiment analysis model to understand customer feedback on e-commerce products. We focused on classifying reviews into positive, and negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained text reviews and star ratings from a database, comprising more than 10,000 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Development/Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained multiple machine learning model to accurately predict the sentiment expressed in reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed the model's predictions to identify trends and patterns in customer sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis Methodology\n",
    "Our methodology involved several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "4. Model Development/Training\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "6. Model Deployment\n",

    "#### Summary of All Models Evaluation:\n",
    "1. `VADER` performs strongly in positive sentiment classification with a high F1-score of 92%. However, it struggles with negative sentiment, achieving only 46% in F1-score. This imbalance, despite its high overall accuracy (87%), limits VADER's reliability for balanced sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Naive Bayes (BoW)` demonstrates strong positive sentiment detection (F1-score of 96%) but falls short on negative sentiment, with a low recall of 16% and an F1-score of 23%. The model’s high overall accuracy (92%) is influenced primarily by positive sentiment, making it less effective for balanced sentiment tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Naive Bayes (TF-IDF)` has significant limitations in negative sentiment detection, with 0% in precision, recall, and F1-score for negatives. Its high accuracy (93%) reflects strong positive sentiment performance, yet this extreme imbalance makes it unsuitable for contexts requiring reliable detection of both sentiment classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Logistic Regression (BoW)` shows balanced but limited performance in detecting both sentiment classes, particularly for negatives, where it achieves only 11% recall and 12% in F1-score. However, it achieves an overall F1-score of 88% due to strong positive sentiment detection. With an accuracy of 89%, Logistic Regression (BoW) provides a more balanced option compared to models like Naive Bayes or XGBoost, though its negative sentiment detection remains limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Logistic Regression (TF-IDF)` has similar results to the BoW model, with slightly better recall (11%) and an F1-score of 12% for negatives, along with a strong F1-score of 94% for positives. It holds a solid accuracy of 89%, making it one of the more balanced models for sentiment analysis, though, like the BoW variant, it could benefit from tuning to improve negative sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `XGBoost (BoW)` performs well with positive sentiment detection (F1-score of 84%), but its negative sentiment detection remains weak (F1-score of 24%), resulting in a lower overall accuracy of 74%. This shows it may not be the best fit for balanced sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `XGBoost (TF-IDF)`follows a similar trend, with a slight improvement in negative sentiment detection (F1-score of 25%) but an overall accuracy of 73%, indicating a limited balance across sentiment classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Overall Insight:`\n",
    "Logistic Regression (both BoW and TF-IDF) provides the best balance across both sentiment classes among all models tested, with reasonable accuracy and F1-scores across classes. While VADER achieves strong accuracy, its imbalance between positive and negative sentiment limits its suitability for tasks needing balanced sentiment detection. Naive Bayes and XGBoost models are notably strong in positive sentiment detection but have difficulty reliably identifying negative sentiment, making them less suitable for balanced sentiment classification tasks."
